This project is a java tutorial on how to make a logging mechanism for a multithreaded application which may have more than one method of storing logging information.
 
The mechanism is implemented as a singleton which is a logging interface. This interface is agnostic and doesn't care about what method is actually being used to store the logging data. The program could be writing to a file, displaying in some GUI text area, writing to a database, or streaming over a network socket. 

With this interface, the user doesn't need to continually change their code in order to implement a new logging method.

This is accomplished using Java's Observer/Observable mechanism so that one (or more) log message producers, can send log messages to one (or more) log message consumers. The method supports multiple log levels (debug, error, etc.).

Happy hunting,
